## FAQ (Placeholder)

- **Q:** Does this support Confluence Data Center?
  **A:** Cloud is the primary target. Data Center may partially work but is not officially supported.

- **Q:** Why are some diagrams not rendered?
  **A:** Some diagram modes require external tools (for example Docker for Mermaid CLI rendering, `plantuml`, `drawio-export`).

- **Q:** Why was my page not updated?
  **A:** Check `--skip-update`, content hash behavior, and write-back metadata (`confluence-page-id`).
